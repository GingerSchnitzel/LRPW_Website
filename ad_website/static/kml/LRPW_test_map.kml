        <description><![CDATA[Area's North Entry/Exit Point<br>Recommended ENTRY procedure<br><br>When flying over BUDA, you should initiate contact with Strejnic Airfield on 131.455 and wait to receive the flight conditions in the area. Entry through this point is performed at 1500ft QNH. The next report from incoming traffc in order to enter the south traffic pattern should be made over the airfield's runway, unless otherwise instructed by the flight coordinator. Entry into the traffic pattern is usually made near the power station.<br><br><br>Recommended EXIT procedure<br><br>Leaving the traffic pattern is done from the downwind leg, following the way to BUDA through the aerodrome's vertical, in an ascending flight towards a minimum of 2000ft QNH. At the vertical of the locality of Buda, contact Bucharest Information on 129.400.]]></description>
